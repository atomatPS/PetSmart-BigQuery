## Need this in Jupyter Notebook to install selenium
! pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org selenium


# Steps:
## 1. Open terminal/Command Prompt 
## 2. Enter in "python"

# Additional steps 
## check if python is installed 
## Use Ctrl + Z to get out of python shell (if already typed in python) Ctrl + D on mac
python - V # Tells you the version of python you have if installed
python -m pip --version # Tells you if pip (which you will need is installed
pip # Tells you also if pip is installed (if you get an error that means its not there)

## If not done already
pip install selenium


## Needed everytime we want to do web scraping 
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()

driver.get('https://google.com') # Or any link you choose

driver.quit # Does not work....
